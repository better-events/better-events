---
Koroflow provides carefully crafted UI components that help you implement privacy-conscious analytics in your applications. Our components are built using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS, offering both beautiful design and robust functionality while integrating seamlessly with our core consent management system.

## Available Components

### Cookie Banner

The Cookie Banner component serves as the primary interface between your users and Koroflow' consent management system. It's designed to be both beautiful and functional, providing a smooth user experience for managing privacy preferences.

```tsx
import { CookieBanner } from "@/components/ui/cookie-banner"

export function MyApp() {
  return (
    <CookieBanner
      title="We value your privacy"
      description="We use cookies to enhance your experience."
      requiredGdprPurposes={["strictly_necessary"]}
    />
  )
}
```

The Cookie Banner component comes with several complementary components that allow you to build a complete consent management interface:

```tsx
import { 
  CookieConsentModal,
  CookieConsentAccept,
  CookieConsentDecline,
  CookieConsentTrigger
} from "@/components/ui/cookie-banner"
```

## Installation

You can install the components using the shadcn/ui CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://koroflow.com/r/cookie-consent-modal"
```

This will add the Cookie Banner and its related components to your project, along with any necessary dependencies.

## Customization

The Cookie Banner component is built with customization in mind. You can modify its appearance using Tailwind CSS classes or extend its functionality through props:

```tsx
<CookieBanner
  className="dark:bg-gray-900"
  buttonClassName="bg-brand hover:bg-brand-dark"
  dialogTitle={<CustomTitle />}
  dialogDescription={<CustomDescription />}
  customSections={<AdditionalPrivacyControls />}
/>
```

## Integration with Consent Management

While the Cookie Banner provides the user interface, it works in tandem with Koroflow' core Consent Manager to handle the actual consent logic. The integration is handled automatically when you use the useAnalytics hook:

```tsx
import { useAnalytics } from "@/lib/analytics"

export function PrivacyControls() {
  const analytics = useAnalytics()
  
  return (
    <CookieBanner
      useAnalytics={analytics}
      requiredGdprPurposes={["strictly_necessary"]}
    />
  )
}
```

This integration ensures that user preferences are properly stored and respected across your application while maintaining a clean separation between the UI and consent management logic.

## Accessibility

The Cookie Banner component is built with accessibility in mind, following WCAG guidelines and best practices. It includes:

- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly content
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management

## Best Practices

When implementing the Cookie Banner, consider these best practices:

1. Always provide clear descriptions of how you use data
2. Make it easy for users to change their preferences
3. Respect user choices and implement them immediately
4. Keep privacy notices concise and understandable
5. Test your implementation across different devices and scenarios
