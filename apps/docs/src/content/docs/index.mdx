## What is consent.management?

consent.management is an open source platform that transforms privacy consent from a compliance checkbox into a fully observable system. Inspired by the developer experience and quality standards set by platforms like Vercel, Clerk, Resend, and Unkey, we're building privacy infrastructure that developers truly deserve.

Built for modern development teams, consent.management unifies analytics, consent management, and privacy controls into a single, performant solution that gives you complete visibility into how users interact with your privacy choices.

Gone are the days of:
- Cookie banners that slow down your site
- Blind spots in consent tracking
- Complex multi-vendor implementations
- Uncertainty about privacy policy changes
- Poor visibility into consent states

## Open Source Foundation

We believe great developer tools should be built in the open. Taking inspiration from platforms we admire, Koroflow is built with:

- **Core Platform**: GNU3 licensed, free to self-host
- **UI Components**: Built on shadcn/ui, fully customizable
- **Server Components**: Next.js app directory ready
- **Cloud Platform**: Coming soon, optional managed service

Just as Vercel revolutionized deployment workflows, Clerk simplified authentication, Resend modernized email infrastructure, and Unkey simplified API key management, we aim to bring that same level of excellence and simplicity to privacy management.
## Current Features (Beta)

Koroflow is currently in early alpha with a focus on core privacy management:

âœ… **Available Now**:
- Full-featured consent management 
- Beautiful shadcn/ui components
- GDPR-compliant privacy controls
- Local storage consent state
- Developer tools for testing

## Performance-First Design

Unlike traditional cookie banners that add hundreds of kilobytes to your bundle size, Koroflow's privacy components are designed with performance in mind:

- **Minimal Bundle Impact**: Built on shadcn/ui with only the essentials
- **Server Components Ready**: Full support for Next.js app directory  
- **Zero Dependencies**: No bloated third-party libraries
- **Smart Chunking**: Components are naturally code-split in modern bundlers

```tsx
// Simple, performant implementation
import { ConsentManagerProvider } from "@@consent-management/react/headless"
import { CookieBanner } from "your-app/ui"

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ConsentManagerProvider
      initialGdprTypes={[
        "necessary",
        "marketing",
        "functionality",
        "measurement",
      ]}
    >
      <CookieBanner />
    </ConsentManagerProvider>
  )
}
```


## Privacy Management UI

Koroflow provides a complete privacy management system built on shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS:

### Core Components
- **Consent Banner**: Customizable, accessible cookie consent notices
- **Preference Center**: Full-featured privacy settings interface
- **Policy Display**: Privacy policy and cookie documentation components
- **Category Management**: Granular consent controls for different tracking types

### Key Features
- Full TypeScript support
- Built on shadcn/ui for consistent design patterns
- Tailwind CSS styling for complete visual control
- Accessible by default
- Server-side state management
- Automatic consent persistence

## Self-Hosting vs Cloud

Koroflow believes in giving you options:

### Self-Hosted (Open Source)
- Full GNU3 licensed platform
- Complete control over your infrastructure
- Free to modify and extend
- Community-supported

### Cloud Platform (Coming Soon)
- Managed infrastructure
- Advanced analytics
- Team collaboration features
- Enterprise support
- Fair pricing model

## Core Principles

### 1. Open Source First
We believe in building in the open, to improve the developer experience and quality of life, but also trust.

### 2. Developer Experience
Clean, TypeScript-first APIs that feel natural to use. Privacy management shouldn't be painful.

### 3. Performance as Standard
No bloated front-ends or slow load times. Every byte is considered.

### 4. Privacy by Design
Consent management isn't a bolt-on - it's a core part of modern web development.
