## Why @consent-management/react?

Building privacy-compliant interfaces isn't just about showing a cookie banner - it's about managing user consent, respecting privacy choices, and maintaining detailed records. We've packaged all of this complexity into simple, customizable components that:

- **Just work out of the box** - Drop our components in and get instant privacy compliance
- **Look and feel native** - Seamlessly match your application's design
- **Handle the legal stuff** - Built-in support for GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations
- **Manage consent automatically** - Smart state management that remembers user preferences
- **Stay up to date** - Automatic updates when regulations change

## Getting Started

1. Install the package:

<Tabs groupId="manual-install" items={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn", "bun"]}>
  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash 
  npm install @consent-management/react
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
  ```bash 
  pnpm install @consent-management/react
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
  ```bash
  yarn add @consent-management/react
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">
  ```bash
  bun add @consent-management/react 
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

2. Add the privacy banner to your app:

```tsx
import {
	ConsentManagerDialog,
	ConsentManagerProvider,
	CookieBanner,
} from "@consent-management/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <ConsentManagerProvider>
      <YourApp />
      <CookieBanner />
      <ConsentManagerDialog />
    </ConsentManagerProvider>
  )
}
```

That's it! You now have a fully compliant privacy system. The banner will automatically:
- Display on first visit
- Remember user preferences
- Handle consent management
- Maintain compliance records
