## Why You Need to Care About CTDPA

The Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA), effective from July 1, 2023, establishes comprehensive data privacy rights for Connecticut residents and imposes specific obligations on businesses handling personal data. Understanding and complying with the CTDPA is crucial for startups operating in or targeting consumers in Connecticut.

## When CTDPA Applies to Your Startup

The CTDPA applies to entities conducting business in Connecticut or producing products or services targeted to Connecticut residents, and that meet one of the following criteria:

- **Control or process the personal data of at least 100,000 consumers annually**, excluding data processed solely for payment transactions.
- **Derive over 25% of gross revenue from the sale of personal data** and process the personal data of at least 25,000 consumers.

Notably, the CTDPA does not include a revenue threshold, focusing instead on the volume of data processed and the nature of the business.

## What Counts as Personal Data

Under the CTDPA, "personal data" refers to any information linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable individual. This excludes de-identified data or publicly available information.

The act also designates certain information as "sensitive data," including:
- Data revealing racial or ethnic origin
- Religious beliefs
- Mental or physical health conditions
- Sexual orientation
- Citizenship or immigration status
- Genetic or biometric data
- Children's data
- Precise geolocation data
