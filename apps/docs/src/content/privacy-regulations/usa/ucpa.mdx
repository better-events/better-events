title: Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA)
---
## Why UCPA Matters for Your Startup

If your startup collects data from Utah residents, understanding the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA) is crucial. While UCPA is less restrictive than CCPA and CPRA, it still introduces key privacy obligations that developers and businesses must follow.

## When UCPA Applies to Your Business

UCPA applies if your startup:
- **Has annual revenue of $25 million or more** AND **either**:
  - Controls or processes personal data of **100,000+ Utah consumers annually**
  - Derives **50%+ revenue from selling personal data** while processing **25,000+ consumers' data**

Even if your startup doesn't meet these thresholds, integrating privacy protections early will help future-proof your compliance strategy.

## What Personal Data Is Covered?

UCPA covers a broad range of **personal data**, including:
- **Traditional Identifiers**: Name, email, phone number
- **Technical Data**: IP addresses, device IDs, cookies
- **Behavioral Data**: Browsing history, purchase history
- **Geolocation Data**: Precise or approximate location
- **Employment & Education Data**: Job titles, academic records
- **Inferences**: User profiles derived from other data points

**Exclusions:** Unlike stricter laws like CPRA, UCPA **excludes** publicly available data, anonymized data, and certain employment-related information.

## Key Consumer Rights & Compliance Requirements

### Right to Know
Consumers can request:
- The **categories of personal data** collected
- The **purposes** for data processing
- The **third parties** data is shared with
- **Retention periods** for personal data

### Right to Delete
Consumers can request deletion of their personal data **if provided directly to your business**. Your startup must:
- Offer a **clear deletion mechanism**
- **Verify** identity before processing deletion requests
- Ensure data is removed from **all systems and backups**
- Notify third-party service providers to delete the data
- Maintain **audit logs** of deletion requests

### Right to Data Portability
Consumers can request a **readily usable format** of their data. Your startup should:
- Provide **structured, machine-readable** exports
- Include **all user-submitted personal data**
- Ensure **secure** transfer methods

### Right to Opt-Out of Data Sales & Targeted Advertising
Consumers have the right to opt out of:
- **Sale of personal data**
- **Targeted advertising based on personal data**
- **Profiling in automated decision-making**

Your business must:
- Provide a **Do Not Sell My Personal Data** link (if applicable)
- Support **opt-out preference signals**
- Honor requests **without requiring user accounts**
- Process opt-outs **within a reasonable timeframe**

### No Private Right of Action
Unlike California's CCPA, UCPA **does not allow individuals to sue businesses** for violations. Only the Utah Attorney General can enforce compliance.
