title: California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)
---

## Why CPRA Matters for Your Startup

If your startup collects data from California residents—especially if you handle user consent—you must comply with the **California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)**. CPRA expands on the **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** and introduces stricter requirements for data privacy, including new rules for sensitive personal information and automated decision-making.

Even if your startup doesn't meet CPRA's compliance thresholds today, implementing best practices early will help you scale efficiently and avoid legal risks as you grow.

## Does CPRA Apply to Your Startup?

Your startup must comply if **any** of the following apply:

- **Annual revenue** exceeds $25 million.
- **Data Transactions:** You buy, sell, or share the personal data of **100,000+ consumers/households** per year (up from CCPA’s 50,000 threshold).
- **Revenue from Data:** At least **50% of annual revenue** comes from selling or sharing personal information.

If you handle user consent and process personal data, compliance is essential—especially with stricter **opt-in and opt-out** requirements.

## What’s New in CPRA? Key Changes for Startups

### 1. **Sensitive Personal Information (SPI) Protections**

- Genetic & biometric data
- Health & sexual orientation data

**Action Items for Your Startup:**
