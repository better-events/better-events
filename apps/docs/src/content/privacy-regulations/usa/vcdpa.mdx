## Why You Need to Care About VCDPA

If your startup collects data from Virginia residents, it's essential to understand the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA). This legislation, effective from January 1, 2023, establishes comprehensive data privacy rights for consumers and imposes specific obligations on businesses operating within or targeting Virginia residents.

## When VCDPA Applies to Your Startup

The VCDPA applies to businesses that:

- **Conduct business in Virginia** or target products and services to Virginia residents, and

- **Meet either of the following criteria**:

  - **Control or process personal data of at least 100,000 consumers** during a calendar year.

  - **Control or process personal data of at least 25,000 consumers** and derive over 50% of gross revenue from the sale of personal data.

Even if your startup doesn't currently meet these thresholds, implementing VCDPA compliance measures early can prevent future challenges as your business expands.

## What Counts as Personal Data

The VCDPA defines personal data as any information that is linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable natural person. This includes:

- **Identifiers**: Names, email addresses, IP addresses.

- **Demographic Information**: Age, gender, race.

- **Behavioral Data**: Browsing history, purchase history.

- **Geolocation Data**: Precise physical locations.

- **Biometric Data**: Fingerprints, facial recognition data.

- **Inferences**: Profiles drawn from other data points.

**Sensitive Data** under the VCDPA includes:

- Data revealing racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, mental or physical health diagnosis, sexual orientation, or citizenship or immigration status.

- Genetic or biometric data processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying an individual.

- Personal data collected from a known child.

- Precise geolocation data.

Processing sensitive data requires obtaining the consumer's consent.

## Key Rights You Need to Support

The VCDPA grants consumers specific rights regarding their personal data:

### Right to Access

Consumers can request:

- Confirmation of whether their personal data is being processed.

- Access to their personal data.

### Right to Correct

Consumers can request:

- Correction of inaccuracies in their personal data.

### Right to Delete

Consumers can request:

- Deletion of their personal data.

### Right to Data Portability

Consumers can request:

- A copy of their personal data in a portable and readily usable format.

### Right to Opt-Out

Consumers have the right to opt-out of:

- The sale of their personal data.

- Targeted advertising.

- Profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer.

## Technical Implementation Requirements

To align with the VCDPA, consider the following technical measures:

### Data Inventory System

- **Comprehensive Data Mapping**: Identify and document all personal data collected, its sources, purposes, and sharing practices.

## Common Technical Challenges

Startups may face several challenges in achieving VCDPA compliance:

### Data Discovery

- **Comprehensive Identification**: Ensuring all personal data is located, including in unstructured data and legacy systems.
