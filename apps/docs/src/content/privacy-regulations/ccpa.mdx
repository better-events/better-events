## Why You Need to Care About CCPA

If you're collecting data from California residents (which you probably are if you have US users), you need to understand CCPA. It's California's privacy law, but it effectively sets the standard for the US market.

## When CCPA Applies to Your Startup

You need to comply if you meet ANY of these:
- Annual revenue > $25 million
- Buy/sell/share data of 50,000+ consumers/households
- Derive 50%+ revenue from selling personal info

Even if you don't meet these yet, implementing CCPA compliance early saves headaches later.

## What Counts as Personal Information

Broader than you might think:
- Traditional identifiers (name, email, etc.)
- Technical data (IP addresses, device IDs)
- Behavioral data (browsing history, search history)
- Geolocation data
- Professional/employment info
- Education information
- Inferences drawn from other data

## Key Rights You Need to Support

### Right to Know
Users can request:
- What personal info you collect
- Where you got it
- Why you collect it
- Who you share it with
- What specific pieces you have

### Right to Delete
- Must provide way to request deletion
- Verify identity before deleting
- Delete from all systems and backups
- Notify service providers to delete

### Right to Opt-Out
- Clear "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link
- Process opt-out requests
- Honor browser privacy signals
- Update all downstream data recipients

## Technical Implementation Requirements

### Data Inventory System
- Track all personal info collected
- Document sources of data
- Map data flows and sharing
- Update inventory regularly

### Verification System
- Verify identity for access/deletion requests
- Risk-appropriate verification methods
- Document verification procedures
- Handle authorized agents

### Response System
- Process requests within 45 days
- Track and document all requests
- Provide required information
- Secure transmission methods

## Practical Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Mapping
- List all personal info collected
- Document all data flows
- Identify sales/sharing of data
- Map third-party transfers

### 2. User Rights Implementation
- Access request mechanism
