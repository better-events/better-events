## Introduction

In the evolving digital landscape, safeguarding personal information is paramount. For startups operating in or engaging with individuals in Saudi Arabia, understanding and complying with the **Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL)** is essential. Enacted to protect individual privacy rights, the PDPL outlines comprehensive requirements for handling personal data within the Kingdom.

## Applicability of the PDPL

The PDPL applies to any entity that processes personal data related to individuals residing in Saudi Arabia, regardless of the entity's location.

**Action Steps:**

## Compliance Roadmap for Startups
