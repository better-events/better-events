title: Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA)

## Why You Need to Care About UCPA

If you're collecting data from Utah residents, you need to understand UCPA. While more limited than CCPA, it's part of the growing patchwork of US privacy laws that developers need to handle.

## When UCPA Applies to Your Startup

You need to comply if you:
- Have annual revenue over $25 million AND EITHER:
- Control/process personal data of 100,000+ Utah consumers yearly OR
- Derive 50%+ revenue from selling personal data AND process 25,000+ consumers' data

Even if you don't meet these thresholds, implementing privacy controls early makes future compliance easier.

## What Counts as Personal Information

Broader than traditional PII:
- Traditional identifiers (name, email, etc.)
- Technical data (IP addresses, device IDs)
- Behavioral data (browsing history, search history)
- Geolocation data
- Professional/employment info
- Education information
- Inferences drawn from other data

## Key Rights You Need to Support

### Right to Know
Users can request:
- Categories of personal data you process
- Specific pieces of personal data
- Purposes for processing
- Categories of third parties data is shared with
- Data retention periods

### Right to Delete
- Must provide mechanism for deletion requests
- Verify identity before deletion
- Delete from all systems and backups
- Notify processors to delete
- Document deletion process

### Right to Data Portability
- Provide data in readily usable format
- Include all user-provided data
- Ensure machine readability
- Enable easy transfer to other services

### Right to Opt Out
- Processing for targeted advertising
- Sale of personal data
- Support opt-out preference signals
- Honor requests within reasonable timeframe

## Technical Implementation Requirements

### Data Inventory System
- Track all personal data collected
- Document sources and purposes
