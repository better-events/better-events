---

## First Steps for New Projects

### 1. Initial Assessment
- What personal data will you collect?
- Where will users be located?
- Which privacy laws apply?
- What security measures are needed?
- Which third-party services will you use?

### 2. Technical Foundation
- Secure infrastructure setup
- Authentication system
- Data encryption
- Access controls
- Logging system

### 3. Documentation Basics
- Privacy policy
- Security procedures
- Data inventory
- Incident response plan
- Training materials

## Technical Implementation Guide

### Data Collection
