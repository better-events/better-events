## Introduction

The `@consent-management/core` package is a headless library designed to transform privacy consent management from a simple compliance checkbox into a fully observable system. It is ideal for modern development teams looking to integrate consent management into their applications while maintaining full control over the user interface. This package unifies analytics, consent tracking, and privacy controls into a single performant solution, eliminating the need for slow cookie banners and addressing blind spots in user privacy choices.

## Why Use @consent-management/core?

- **Headless Architecture**: Provides the core logic and state management for consent without imposing any UI constraints, allowing developers to build custom interfaces tailored to their application's needs.
- **Custom UI Development**: Perfect for teams that want to design their own consent interfaces while leveraging robust backend logic.
- **Flexibility and Control**: Offers complete control over how consents are displayed and managed, enabling seamless integration with existing systems and workflows.

## Installation

To install the package, use one of the following commands:

```package-install
@consent-management/core
```

## Usage

### Basic Setup

To create a consent manager store, import and use the `createConsentManagerStore` function. This store will handle all consent-related state and logic:

```typescript
import { createConsentManagerStore } from '@consent-management/core';

const store = createConsentManagerStore();

// Subscribe to state changes
const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(
  state => console.log('Consent updated:', state.consents)
);

// Update consent
store.getState().setConsent('analytics', true);
```

### Use Cases

1. **Custom Consent UI**: Use the core library to manage consent logic while building a custom UI that matches your application's design language.
2. **Integration with Analytics**: Seamlessly integrate consent management with analytics tools to ensure compliance with privacy regulations.
3. **Dynamic Consent Management**: Adjust consent options dynamically based on user location or preferences, using the library's flexible API.

### Managing Consents

You can manage user consents using various methods provided by the store:

<Tabs groupId="Method" items={["Set Consent", "Save Consents", "Reset Consents"]}>
<Tab value="Set Consent">
Update consent for a specific type.
  ```typescript
  import { createConsentManagerStore } from '@consent-management/core';
 
  const store = createConsentManagerStore();
 
  store.getState().setConsent('marketing', true);
  ```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Save Consents">
Save user preferences.
  ```typescript
  import { createConsentManagerStore } from '@consent-management/core';
 
  const store = createConsentManagerStore();
 
  store.getState().saveConsents('all');
  ```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Reset Consents">
 Reset all consents to default values.
  ```typescript

  import { createConsentManagerStore } from '@consent-management/core';
 
  const store = createConsentManagerStore();
 
  store.getState().resetConsents();
  ```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
